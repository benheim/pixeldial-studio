# Prospecting Plan — PixelDial Studio

## Target Niches
1. Indie electronic / alt-pop musicians
2. Small record labels (vinyl, tapes, niche digital labels)
3. Creative studios / design collectives
4. Streetwear micro-brands
5. Event series / underground party brands

## Where to Find Leads
- Instagram: hashtags + tagged posts (#indieelectronic, #newmusicfriday, #streetwearbrand, #creativeagency)
- Bandcamp: new releases in electronic/experimental tags
- SoundCloud + Spotify artist discovery (emerging artists with weak web presence)
- Behance/Dribbble directories (small studios without strong websites)
- Local scene calendars / flyers / venue pages
- Reddit + Discord communities for music and design scenes

## Cold Email Template (Short + Personalized)
Subject: quick idea for {{brand}}’s site

Hey {{first_name}},

Love the visual world around {{specific project/song/release}}.
I run a small studio focused on polished Y2K-inspired websites for music + culture brands.

I mocked up a quick idea for how {{brand}} could present {{new release / offering}} more clearly and convert more visitors.

If useful, I can send a 3-bullet teardown + a one-page concept.
